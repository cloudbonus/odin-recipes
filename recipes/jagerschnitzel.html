    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jägerschnitzel is a popular German dish made with tenderized pork or veal cutlets coated in breadcrumbs and pan-fried until golden brown. The name "Jägerschnitzel" literally means "hunter's cutlet" and is said to originate from the fact that hunters in Germany would prepare a similar dish while out in the woods. The cutlets are often served with a rich mushroom gravy and fried potatoes or spaetzle on the side.</p>
       <p>The key to a perfect Jägerschnitzel is to use high-quality meat and ensure that the cutlets are evenly pounded to a uniform thickness. The breadcrumbs should be well-seasoned with herbs such as parsley and thyme, and the cutlets should be pan-fried in plenty of oil until crispy and golden brown. The mushroom gravy is typically made with fresh mushrooms, onions, and beef broth, and is thickened with a roux made from flour and butter. The result is a hearty, comforting dish that is sure to please even the pickiest of eaters.</p>

            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
            <li>1 cube beef bouillon</li>

            <li>½ cup sour cream</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a shallow dish, mix together the bread crumbs and flour. Season with salt and pepper. Place the egg in a separate dish. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dip pork steaks in egg, then coat with the bread crumb mixture. Fry in the hot oil until browned on both sides and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Remove the pork to a platter and keep warm. Add onion and mushrooms to the skillet and cook until lightly browned. Pour in water and dissolve the bouillon cube. Simmer for about 20 minutes. Stir together the cornstarch and sour cream; stir into the skillet. Cook over low heat until thickened but do not boil. Spoon over the pork cutlets and serve immediately. </li>
