				<p>
					Jägerschnitzel is a popular German dish made with tenderized pork or veal
					cutlets coated in breadcrumbs and pan-fried until golden brown. The name
					"Jägerschnitzel" literally means "hunter's cutlet" and is said to
					originate from the fact that hunters in Germany would prepare a similar
					dish while out in the woods. The cutlets are often served with a rich
					mushroom gravy and fried potatoes or spaetzle on the side.
				</p>
				<p>
					The key to a perfect Jägerschnitzel is to use high-quality meat and ensure
					that the cutlets are evenly pounded to a uniform thickness. The
					breadcrumbs should be well-seasoned with herbs such as parsley and thyme,
					and the cutlets should be pan-fried in plenty of oil until crispy and
					golden brown. The mushroom gravy is typically made with fresh mushrooms,
					onions, and beef broth, and is thickened with a roux made from flour and
					butter. The result is a hearty, comforting dish that is sure to please
					even the pickiest of eaters.
